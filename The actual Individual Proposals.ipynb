    "1. Does Talking to People Increase Happiness?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question**: *Does general social interaction make people happier?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Parameter: The average happiness score for each level of interaction frequency to see if more frequent interactions correlate with higher happiness.\n",

    "**Variables**:\n",
    "- Independent: Frequency of social interactions:\n",
    "  - `CONNECTION_activities_talked_day_p3m`: Daily interactions.\n",

    "I want to:\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean happiness score for each frequency level.\n",
    "2. Use standard error to visualize variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Higher social interaction frequency such as daily or weekly, will correlate with higher happiness scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: If frequent social interaction is linked to higher happiness, it suggests that promoting regular social engagement could improve well-being.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Research Question**: *Does getting “just the right amount” of sleep reduce tiredness?*\n",

    "- Dependent: Tiredness frequency (`WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_tired`), with options like \"Always,\" \"Very Often,\" \"Rarely,\" etc.\n",

    "1. Calculate the average tiredness score for each sleep category.\n",
    "2. Use standard error bars to display variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Individuals with “just the right amount” of sleep will report lower tiredness than those with “too much” or “too little” sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: Supports balanced sleep for reducing tiredness, potentially useful for public health messaging.\n",

    "  - \"No Commute\"\n",
    "  - \"Less than 15 minutes\"\n",
    "  - \"15 to 29 minutes\"\n",
    "  - \"30 to 44 minutes\"\n",
    "  - \"45 to 59 minutes\"\n",
    "  - \"60 minutes and over\"\n",

    "**Analysis Plan**:\n",

    "I want to:\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean life satisfaction score for each commute category.\n",
    "2. Use standard error to illustrate variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis**: Shorter commutes are associated with higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: If shorter commutes lead to higher life satisfaction, this could support policies promoting remote work or reducing commute times for better well-being.\n"
